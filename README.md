# Web Components + Hooks Demo

This demonstrates a basic shopping cart built using Web Components. It also has State Management, Routing, CSS-in-JS and doesn't require a build!

- Hooks through [haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted)
- Context API through [haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted)

- CSS-in-JS through [goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober)
- Build through [parceljs](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) - this is *optional*, check the `no-build` branch for a demo without the build step
